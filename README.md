Quick and Dirty prototype of a browser-based agility course editor with 3D capabilities

The backend is just an incredibly dumb datastore of the json generated by the web app using MySQL for persistence. The only potentially useful things are in the javascript side, converting a 2D agility course into a 3D representation. 

Everything was hacked together fairly hastily as an experiment but it might be useful as a starting point for a potential future rewrite.
